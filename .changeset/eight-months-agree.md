UI updates to GCP-projects plugin

Adds the following to the project list page:

- pagination
- filtering
- sorting
- rows per page
- show/hide columns

Makes breadcrumb a link back to project list for the project details and new project views.

In project list page, updates New project button to use RouterLink instead of `href` to avoid login prompt.

In project details view, links to project details and logs now work, clicking on these will open the project or logs in GCP in new tab.
